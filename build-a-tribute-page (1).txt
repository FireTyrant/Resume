            "I was born and raised in Fremont, California. I am very much into learning about new cultures, traveling, and trying new restaurants to find that new drink or dish I will fall in love with. I do like to cook at home trying new recipes or cooking something just to try a new technique. I am also into a variety of music, you may catch me from time to time with ear buds listening to anything from Retro wave to Hard Rock. I have not traveled to many countries; however, Ireland has been my favorite spot so far.</br>
 
<br>Currently, I am helping our Operations Division finding ways to improve process and/or cost efficiency through data aggregation.</br>

<br>I love my job! I get to work with people who help patients get the home care they need to stay healthy. With that, I get to learn all aspects of the company, from IT to Customer Service.</br> 

<br>I consider myself a self-starter who is not afraid to learn something new. In fact I am always learning something new and you can regularly find me taking a course through LinkedIn Learning or Trailhead. I am currently working on my Salesforce Administration Certification while learning SQL."</br>
